**APO is divided into two parts:**

- **APO-server:** The server-side component of APO.
- **APO-one-agent:** The client-side component of APO, used to collect information about monitored services and cluster/host information in Kubernetes clusters or virtual machine environments.

This document contains instructions for installing and running `APO-server` and `APO-one-agent` on **the same Kubernetes cluster** using Helm.

:::warning

This document is intended for quick deployment during the POC testing phase and **is a non-persistent configuration**. Do not use it in production environments. For production use, it is recommended to **install APO-server in an independent environment**. For installation instructions, please refer to [Installing APO-Server](/docs/Installation/APO%20Server.md).

:::

## Prerequisites
To install APO using Helm, ensure the following steps have been completed:

- Prepare hardware resources of 8 cores and 16GB of RAM. Disk resources depend on your monitoring scale, with a minimum of 50GB.
- Install a Kubernetes server on your machine. For information on installing Kubernetes, refer to the official documentation [Installing Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/docs/setup/).
- Install the latest stable version of Helm. For information on installing Helm, refer to [Installing Helm](https://helm.sh/docs/intro/install/).

## Setting Up the APO Helm Repository
To set up the APO Helm repository to download the correct APO Helm charts on your machine, complete the following steps:
**Use the following command to add the** `apo` **Helm repository:**
```bash
helm repo add apo https://clouddetail.github.io/apo-helm-charts
helm repo update apo
```

## Deploying APO Helm Charts
Run the following command to deploy `APO-server` and `APO-one-agent`.
```bash
# BASEIP Change this to the IP address or domain name used to access the APO-server via a web browser. No port number is required. It must be the same as the node where apo-difyâ€™s hostPath is located.
# HOSTNAME The node name specified in hostPath for apo-dify.
export BASEIP=xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx
export NODENAME=xxxx

helm install apo apo/apo -n apo --create-namespace \
--set apo-one-agent.enabled=true
--set apo-dify.nodeSelector={kubernetes.io/hostname: $NODENAME}
--set global.baseURL="http://$BASEIP"
--set apo-dify.hostPath="/data/apo/dify"
```
> **Configuration 1:** By default, apo-one-agent monitors all components except for apo and Kubernetes system components. For more configurations, refer to [Modify Automatic Injection Scope](/docs/Distibuted%20Tracing/Modify%20Automatic%20Injection%20Scope.md).

> **Configuration 2:** The Go language Trace probe Grafana-Beyla in apo-one-agent is disabled by default. Beyla requires a system kernel version of 5.8 or higher. For details, see the [Grafana-Beyla Official Documentation](https://grafana.com/docs/beyla/latest/). To enable Grafana-Beyla to collect Go language service Trace data, add the parameter `--set apo-one-agent.grafanaBeyla.enabled=true` to the deployment command.

:::warning

This document is intended for quick deployment during the POC testing phase and **is a non-persistent configuration**. Restarting the database component may result in data loss or service crashes. Do not use it in production environments. For production use, it is recommended to **install APO-server in an independent environment**. For installation instructions, please refer to [Installing APO-server](/docs/Installation/APO%20Server.md).

:::

## Verification
Enter the following command to check if the pods have started successfully:
```bash
kubectl get po -n apo
```
:::info

After successful installation, the target monitored service must be restarted!!!
**Encountered Issues**:

- If `apo-one-agent` is not ready and is in the `6/7` or `6/8` state, you can further troubleshoot by referring to the documents [ã€ŠResolving ebpf-agent Not Ready Issueã€‹](/docs/Troubleshooting/eBPF-Agent%20Unready%20Issue.md) and [ã€ŠResolving grafana-beyla Not Ready Issueã€‹](/docs/Troubleshooting/Grafana-Beyla%20Unready%20Issue.md).

## Accessing APO
You can access APO through the following methods, where `NodeIP` is the IP address of any node in the cluster.
- APO Guided Observability Platform Address: `http://<NodeIP>:31364`; Default Username/Password: admin/APO2024@admin

## Updates and Uninstallation
### Updating APO Helm Charts Configuration
If your APO needs to be updated, use the following command to update:
```bash
helm upgrade apo apo/apo -n apo \
--set apo-one-agent.enabled=true
```
### Uninstalling APO Helm Charts
```bash
kubectl delete clickhouseinstallation apo -napo
helm uninstall apo -n apo
kubectl delete ns apo
```
### Additional Configurations
This document provides the basic configuration for APO deployment. If you need to make more configuration changes, download the `values.yaml` file from the APO Helm Charts repository:
```bash
helm show values apo/apo > values.yaml
```

## Additional Installation Methods
- [Installing APO-Server](/docs/Installation/APO%20Server.md): It is recommended to use this installation method to isolate `APO-server` and the monitored services in different environments.
- [Installation APO-OneAgent](/docs/Installation/APO%20OneAgent.md): Install and run `APO-one-agent`.

### Deploying APO Community Edition
By default, APO installs the Enterprise Edition, which provides more data analysis capabilities compared to the Community Edition. For differences, please refer to [Version Differences](/docs/About%20APO/What%20is%20APO.md).

:::danger[Notice]

The Enterprise Edition features of APO are currently in free public betaðŸ”¥!!!

:::

If needed, you can also use the Community Edition by adding the following parameter to the installation command:
```
--set global.edition=ce
```
